Why?
---
Because I needed a tiny webserver which would only accept GET calls, which would show statistics, and which would follow redirects when proxying a call (instead of forwarding the redirect to the client).

Our previous solution was an obscure proxy, written in C, which was no longer maintained. Lua is a lot more readable, and LuaSocket sinks are awesome!

Dependencies
------------

- Lua 5.x
- LuaSocket
- LuaMemcached
- LuaMD5

I would suggest installing those with luarocks.

Running
-------

Running is done by:
# lua bitmovr.lua 0.0.0.0:50000

You can have as much bitmovr instances running as you want, you can have your frontend servers forward the calls to bitmovr, eg in nginx:

location /xyz {
	proxy_cache plop;
	proxy_cache_valid 240h; # cache for 10 days
	proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:50000;
}
